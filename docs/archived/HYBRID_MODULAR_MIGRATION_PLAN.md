## Executive Summary

### Current State

- **Total Layer Violations:** 27 files in shared/ importing from features/
- **Code Duplication:** 540+ lines across Kana/Kanji/Vocabulary game components
- **Hub Pattern Anti-Pattern:** Progress/useStatsStore imported by 25+ files
- **Missing Abstractions:** No shared game orchestration, no unified facades
- **Missing Public APIs:** 8 features lack barrel exports (index.ts)

### Target State

- **Layer Violations:** 0 (enforced by ESLint)
- **Code Duplication:** < 100 lines (90% reduction via TrainingGame widget)
- **Decoupled Stats:** Event-based system, < 10 direct imports
- **Unified Widgets:** 5 major widgets abstracting cross-feature composition
- **Complete Public APIs:** All features expose clean barrel exports

### Migration Strategy

**Hybrid Modular Architecture:**

- **Features remain** as primary organizational unit
- **Widgets layer** added for complex UI compositions
- **Facades** abstract feature store access for cross-feature needs
- **Strict enforcement** via ESLint import rules
- **No entities layer** (too heavyweight for current scope)

## Migration Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Eliminate Layer Violations:** shared/ must never import from features/
2. **Eliminate Duplication:** Abstract game logic into shared widgets
3. **Decouple Stats System:** Break Progress store hub pattern
4. **Create Clean APIs:** All features expose public barrel exports
5. **Enforce Boundaries:** ESLint rules prevent future violations

### Secondary Goals

6. **Improve DX:** Faster navigation with clear boundaries
7. **Enable Testing:** Isolated facades easier to mock
8. **Prepare for Scale:** Architecture supports 50+ features
9. **Maintain Performance:** No runtime overhead from abstraction
10. **OSS-Friendly:** Simpler mental model for contributors

| `widgets/`  | features (via facade), shared, core            | feature stores directly        | ESLint      |
| `features/` | other features (via index.ts), shared, core    | other feature internals        | ESLint      |
| `shared/`   | shared, core                                   | features, widgets              | ESLint ✅   |
| `core/`     | core only                                      | app, widgets, features, shared | ESLint      |

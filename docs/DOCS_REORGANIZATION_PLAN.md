# Documentation Reorganization Plan

## Executive Summary

The current README.md is 657 lines and contains extensive duplicate content that already exists in dedicated documentation files. This plan outlines how to trim the README to ~120 lines and properly organize all documentation.

```

### 2. Update CONTRIBUTING.md

Move the detailed "Getting Started" setup instructions from README to CONTRIBUTING.md. Currently CONTRIBUTING.md already has good setup instructions, so we mainly need to:

- Ensure the troubleshooting section links to `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Remove any duplicate content

### 3. Create docs/README.md (Documentation Index)

Create a central index for all documentation:

```markdown
# KanaDojo Documentation

## Getting Started

- [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) - Setup and contribution workflow
- [Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Common issues and solutions

## Architecture & Development

- [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - Project structure, patterns, and conventions
- [UI Design](./UI_DESIGN.md) - Theming, styling, and component guidelines
- [Performance](./PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md) - Performance optimization details
- [Audio](./AUDIO_OPTIMIZATION.md) - Audio system documentation

## Features

- [Achievements](./ACHIEVEMENTS.md) - Achievement system documentation
- [SEO](./SEO.md) - SEO implementation guide

## Internationalization

- [Translation Guide](./TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md) - How to translate the app
- [Adding Languages](./ADDING_LANGUAGES.md) - How to add new language support

## Archives

Historical documentation for completed migrations:

- [archived/](./archived/) - Migration plans and historical docs
```

### 4. Archive Completed Migration Docs

Move to `docs/archived/`:

- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/archived/MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `FACADE_ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md` → `docs/archived/FACADE_ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md`

### 5. Files to Delete (Duplicates)

None - all existing docs serve a purpose. The cleanup is about:

1. Trimming README.md
2. Proper linking between docs
3. Creating the docs index

---

## Section-by-Section Migration

### From README.md → Delete (exists elsewhere)

| README Section                    | Existing Location           | Action                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| UI & Design Philosophy            | `docs/UI_DESIGN.md`         | Delete from README, link to doc  |
| Tech Stack (detailed)             | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`      | Keep 1-line version, link to doc |
| Architecture                      | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`      | Delete from README, link to doc  |
| Getting Started (troubleshooting) | `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`   | Delete from README, link to doc  |
| Project Structure                 | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`      | Delete from README, link to doc  |
| Key Concepts                      | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`      | Delete from README, link to doc  |
| Translation Contributions         | `docs/TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` | Delete from README, link to doc  |
| i18n System Status                | `docs/TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` | Delete from README               |
| Language Expansion for SEO        | `docs/ADDING_LANGUAGES.md`  | Delete from README               |

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create `docs/README.md`** - Documentation index
2. **Move archived docs** - `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` and `FACADE_ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md`
3. **Rewrite `README.md`** - Trim to ~120 lines with proper links
4. **Update cross-references** - Ensure all docs link to each other properly
5. **Update translated READMEs** - They may need similar trimming (optional, can be separate PR)

---

## Benefits

- **README.md**: 657 lines → ~120 lines (82% reduction)
- **No lost information**: Everything moved to proper docs
- **Better discoverability**: Central docs index
- **Cleaner architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Easier maintenance**: Update docs in one place, not multiple

---

## Questions for Review

1. Should we also trim the translated READMEs in this pass, or handle separately?
2. Should `docs/README.md` be named `docs/INDEX.md` instead?
3. Any sections I've marked for removal that you want to keep in README?

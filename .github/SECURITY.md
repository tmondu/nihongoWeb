## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing code, follow these security practices:

#### 1. Input Validation

Always validate user input:

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - no validation
const userId = request.url.searchParams.get('id');
db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);

// ✅ Correct - validated and typed
const userId = parseInt(request.url.searchParams.get('id') || '0');
if (userId <= 0) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid ID' }, { status: 400 });
}
```

#### 2. Sanitize Output

Prevent XSS attacks:

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - raw output
<div>{userInput}</div>

// ✅ Correct - sanitized
import { sanitize } from '@/shared/utils/security';
<div>{sanitize(userInput)}</div>
```

#### 3. Use Environment Variables for Secrets

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - hardcoded secret
const apiKey = 'sk-12345...';

// ✅ Correct - from environment
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

#### 4. Follow the Principle of Least Privilege

Only request necessary permissions:

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - excessive permissions
await octokit.request('GET /user', {
  headers: { authorization: `token ${token}` },
});

// ✅ Correct - minimal scope
await octokit.request('GET /user', {
  headers: { authorization: `token ${token}` },
  mediaType: { previews: ['machine-man'] },
});
```

### Environment Variables

Never commit secrets to the repository:

```
# .env.local (never commit this)
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=your-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
```

Required secrets are set in Vercel, not in the codebase.

## Dependencies Security

### Dependency Updates

- **Dependabot**: Automatically scans for vulnerabilities
- **Update frequency**: Weekly checks for updates
- **Critical fixes**: Applied as soon as possible

### Checking for Vulnerabilities

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

# Bug Report Pipeline

This folder contains the server-only implementation for turning Tally bug reports into Supabase records and GitHub issues.

```txt
Tally form
  -> app/api/webhooks/tally/bug-report
  -> Supabase bug_reports row
  -> immediate processing scheduled with Next.js after()
  -> DeepSeek cleanup
  -> Supabase Storage attachment copy
  -> GitHub issue
  -> app/api/process-bug-reports cron retry safety net
```

The Tally webhook is push-based. Tally sends a request immediately when a user submits the form. The 5-minute Vercel Cron retry is not polling Tally; it only picks up reports that were safely stored but not fully processed.

## Manual Setup Checklist

### Supabase

Create or select the KanaDojo Supabase project.

The Supabase CLI is installed locally with Scoop. If a new shell does not find `supabase`, use the shim directly:

```powershell
$env:USERPROFILE\scoop\shims\supabase.exe --version
```

The repo has already been initialized with Supabase CLI config and a migration:

```txt
supabase/config.toml
supabase/migrations/20260618190346_bug_report_pipeline.sql
```

That migration creates:

- `public.bug_reports`
- `public.bug_report_attachments`
- RLS-enabled private tables
- helpful processing indexes
- `updated_at` trigger
- private Storage bucket `bug-report-attachments`

Completed remote setup:

- Logged in with Supabase CLI.
- Linked this repo to project `kana-dojo` / `tplfaltoxejyvyxvwwoo`.
- Pushed `20260618190346_bug_report_pipeline.sql` to the remote database.

The commands used were:

```powershell
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
supabase db push
```

Keep the tables and bucket private for v1. The server uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`; do not expose it to client code.

### GitHub

Production already has an encrypted Vercel `GITHUB_PAT`, and this pipeline reuses it.

If that token ever needs to be rotated, create a fine-grained personal access token for `lingdojo/kana-dojo` with:

```txt
Issues: Read and write
Metadata: Read
```

Store it in Vercel as `GITHUB_PAT` for Production.

### DeepSeek

The API key has been added to Vercel Production as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

Optional model override:

```txt
DEEPSEEK_BUG_REPORT_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
```

The default code path uses `deepseek-v4-flash` with `thinking: { type: 'disabled' }`. This is the lowest-cost/lowest-latency thinking setting for bug report cleanup. DeepSeek's `reasoning_effort` only applies when thinking is enabled; `low` and `medium` are mapped to `high`, so disabling thinking is the actual minimum.

### Vercel

The pipeline only needs Production env vars because we are not doing end-to-end GitHub issue creation from Preview.

These Production vars have been added through the Vercel CLI:

```txt
TALLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
TALLY_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=
BUG_REPORT_PROCESSOR_SECRET=

SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
SUPABASE_BUG_REPORT_BUCKET=bug-report-attachments

GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=lingdojo
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=kana-dojo
```

These Production vars already existed and are reused:

```txt
CRON_SECRET
GITHUB_PAT
```

This Production var has been added:

```txt
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

Optional:

```txt
DEEPSEEK_BUG_REPORT_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
```

Production env vars were also pulled into ignored `.env.local`. The previous local file was backed up to an ignored `.env.local.backup-*` file.

`CRON_SECRET` is already used by existing cron routes. The processor route accepts either `BUG_REPORT_PROCESSOR_SECRET` or `CRON_SECRET`.

### Tally

In the Tally bug report form:

1. Open `Integrations`.
2. Choose `Webhooks`.
3. Add endpoint URL:

```txt
https://kanadojo.com/api/webhooks/tally/bug-report
```

4. Add custom HTTP header:

```txt
Authorization: Bearer <TALLY_WEBHOOK_TOKEN>
```

5. Add the signing secret matching `TALLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
   - The generated values are available locally in ignored `.env.local`.
6. Submit one test report without an attachment.
7. Submit one test report with a screenshot.

## What Still Requires Manual Account Work

These steps cannot be completed from this terminal without account-specific secrets or browser authorization:

- Tally webhook: must be configured inside the Tally form dashboard.

Everything that can be made repeatable in this repo has been moved into `supabase/migrations/20260618190346_bug_report_pipeline.sql`.

## Module Responsibilities

`auth.ts`
: Verifies bearer tokens and Tally HMAC signatures. Tally signatures are checked by calculating HMAC SHA-256 over `JSON.stringify(payload)` and comparing the base64 digest to `Tally-Signature`.

`tally.ts`
: Converts Tally's flexible field payload into a stable `NormalizedBugReport`. Field labels are matched with forgiving aliases so the Tally form can evolve without requiring immediate code changes.

`supabaseAdmin.ts`
: Creates the server-only Supabase client with the service role key and provides the bug report Storage bucket name.

`attachments.ts`
: Downloads Tally file upload URLs, validates MIME type and size, copies accepted images to Supabase Storage, inserts `bug_report_attachments` metadata, and creates signed URLs for GitHub issue links.

`deepseek.ts`
: Stores the DeepSeek prompt, sends normalized report data to `deepseek-v4-flash` with thinking disabled, validates the JSON response with `zod`, clamps labels/title/severity, and falls back to raw normalized fields when DeepSeek is unavailable or returns invalid JSON.

`github.ts`
: Formats the final GitHub issue body and creates the issue using the GitHub REST API.

`processor.ts`
: Orchestrates the full processing transaction: load pending reports, mark attempts, copy attachments, format with DeepSeek, create the GitHub issue, and update Supabase status.

## Status Lifecycle

```txt
received
processing
github_created
retryable_error
failed
```

Rules:

- `received`: raw report stored, not yet fully processed.
- `processing`: an immediate or cron processor run is working on the report.
- `github_created`: GitHub issue was created and stored back on the row.
- `retryable_error`: GitHub or another retryable processing step failed.
- `failed`: the report reached 5 attempts.

## Attachment Policy

Accepted MIME types:

```txt
image/png
image/jpeg
image/webp
```

Limits:

```txt
max files per report: 3
max file size: 10 MB
storage path: bug-reports/<report-id>/<uuid>-<safe-file-name>
```

Attachment failures are non-fatal. The GitHub issue still gets created, and the attachment error is included in triage notes.

## DeepSeek Contract

DeepSeek is used as a formatter, not as the source of truth. The code still enforces all important constraints.

The prompt asks DeepSeek to return JSON with:

```json
{
  "title": "Short GitHub issue title, max 90 characters",
  "summary": "Clear one-paragraph summary of the bug",
  "stepsToReproduce": ["Step 1", "Step 2"],
  "expectedBehavior": "What the user expected, or null",
  "actualBehavior": "What happened instead, or null",
  "environment": {
    "pageUrl": "URL or null",
    "feature": "Feature area or null",
    "device": "Device or null",
    "browser": "Browser or null",
    "locale": "Locale/language or null"
  },
  "severity": "low | medium | high | critical",
  "labels": ["bug", "user-report", "needs-triage"],
  "triageNotes": "Brief maintainer-facing notes, or null",
  "missingInfo": ["Question that would help debugging"]
}
```

The code enforces:

```txt
title <= 90 characters
labels are whitelist-only
bug, user-report, needs-triage are always present
severity is low, medium, high, or critical
invalid JSON falls back to normalized raw fields
```

Allowed labels:

```txt
bug
user-report
needs-triage
accessibility
mobile
desktop
regression
```

## GitHub Issue Output

Each issue includes:

```txt
Summary
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
Actual Behavior
Environment
Attachments
Triage Notes
Missing Info
Source
Original User-Entered Fields
```

The source section includes the Supabase report ID and Tally submission ID so maintainers can trace a GitHub issue back to the stored raw payload.

The final `Original User-Entered Fields` section appends the raw text fields from Tally after the cleaned report, so maintainers can compare DeepSeek's formatted summary against the user's unaltered input.
